# strands_agent

Prototype repo for learning the **Strands Agent SDK** deeply by building a simple, interactive **terminal UI coding-agent platform**.

The goal is not to clone Claude Code or Kiro exactly. The goal is to understand the Strands mental model by building a compact platform that feels similar in spirit:
- chat-first,
- tool-using,
- coding-oriented,
- interactive in a terminal,
- incrementally extensible.

This repo should stay focused on one core question:

**What is the smallest useful coding-agent platform we can build using Strands as the primary agent runtime?**

## Product direction

Build a local TUI app that launches a coding agent workspace with:
- a conversation pane,
- tool execution visibility,
- file/workspace awareness,
- session history,
- and guardrails/steering hooks.

The platform should help Steve learn Strands by making the agent loop visible and hackable rather than hidden behind a black box.

## Why this prototype

Strands appears to be a strong fit for this because it gives us:
- a model-driven agent loop,
- tool definitions as normal functions,
- MCP support,
- streaming support,
- steering hooks / middleware,
- multi-agent extensibility later.

That makes it a very good substrate for a coding-agent TUI where the interesting part is not just chat, but:
- how tools are exposed,
- how the loop is observed,
- how tool calls are steered,
- how state/history is managed,
- and how coding workflows feel in practice.

## Initial product shape

The first version should be a Python TUI application that:
- opens in the terminal,
- lets the user type tasks/questions,
- runs a Strands agent behind the scenes,
- shows streaming responses,
- shows tool calls/results as separate UI events,
- can operate against a local workspace,
- and supports a small built-in coding-tool set.

## Current status

**Phase 1 is complete, and the next configuration seam is now in place.**

Phase 1 is implemented as a working vertical slice with a deliberate testing-first shape.

What exists now:
- a runnable Textual TUI scaffold,
- a thin runtime boundary separate from the UI,
- a deterministic **fake Strands runtime** for reliable local verification,
- a live **Strands + OpenAI** runtime path driven by environment variables,
- explicit CLI overrides for runtime and model selection,
- status-line rendering that makes the selected runtime mode and model visible,
- tests that prove prompt submission updates the TUI state,
- a local smoke script for validating the real runtime without committing secrets.

What changed this run:
- added `--runtime {fake,live}` and `--model <model-id>` CLI controls to `strands-agent`,
- added config merge logic so one-off launches can override environment defaults cleanly,
- updated the TUI status line to show runtime, mode, model, and turn count together,
- expanded tests to cover config merging and CLI argument parsing.

Why the fake runtime exists:
- It gives us a stable way to verify the TUI-to-agent loop even if live model credentials are missing or flaky.
- It prevents Phase 1 from being "conceptually done" but operationally untestable.
- It gives future phases a safe regression harness.

How we know the prototype is working right now:
- unit tests verify runtime behavior,
- app tests verify prompt submission updates history and output,
- the TUI status line updates with runtime/mode/model/turn count,
- runtime errors are surfaced visibly in the UI,
- `pytest` currently passes for the Phase 1 scaffold,
- the CLI help renders correctly for the new launch controls,
- a live local smoke check has succeeded against the OpenAI-backed Strands runtime,
- a manual live TUI interaction pass succeeded and confirmed prompt -> response rendering in the actual app.

Current evidence:
- automated tests: `12 passed`
- CLI verification: `strands-agent --help` shows `--runtime` and `--model`
- live smoke result: successful OpenAI-backed Strands response
- manual live TUI result: prompt `hi` rendered a real assistant response and updated status to `Runtime: strands-openai | Mode: live | Turns: 1`

## First five phases

The first five phases should optimize for learning Strands through a runnable vertical slice, not for shipping a giant framework.

### Phase 1, Basic Strands-backed TUI shell

Status: **Complete**

**Objective**
Build a minimal terminal UI that can:
- start,
- render a prompt/input area,
- send a user message to a Strands agent,
- and display the streamed or final assistant response.

**Feature slice**
- basic TUI layout,
- single-session chat loop,
- one configurable model provider,
- simple Strands runtime wrapper,
- local dev quickstart.

**Why this is first**
This proves the base interaction loop and forces us to understand the core Strands API surface before we add coding complexity.

**Success test for Phase 1**
- app launches locally with one command,
- user can enter a prompt,
- the runtime produces a response in the TUI,
- a deterministic fake runtime proves the UI loop without needing live credentials,
- tests validate app startup, runtime invocation boundary, and prompt submission behavior,
- a live OpenAI-backed Strands run succeeds locally.

### Phase 2, Coding tools + workspace awareness

**Objective**
Add a compact local toolbelt so the agent can act like a coding assistant in a workspace.

**Feature slice**
- read file tool,
- write/edit file tool,
- list/search workspace tool,
- shell command tool with conservative limits,
- current working directory / repo context indicator in UI.

**Why this matters**
This is the point where the app stops being a generic chat shell and starts becoming a coding-agent platform.

**Success test for Phase 2**
- agent can inspect files and propose/edit code in a test workspace,
- TUI visibly shows tool calls and results,
- integration tests validate tool registration and at least one workspace task end-to-end.

### Phase 3, Agent event timeline + observability

**Objective**
Make the Strands loop legible by exposing intermediate events, tool uses, failures, and timings in the TUI.

**Feature slice**
- event log pane,
- structured rendering for tool call start/end,
- token/latency counters where feasible,
- error surfacing,
- saved run transcript/artifact output.

**Why this matters**
If the goal is to understand Strands deeply, hidden orchestration is the enemy. This phase turns the loop into something inspectable.

**Success test for Phase 3**
- a user can distinguish model output from tool activity,
- failed tools/errors are visible in the UI,
- transcript artifacts are written to disk,
- tests validate event serialization/rendering.

### Phase 4, Steering hooks + safety rails

**Objective**
Use Strands steering/middleware style hooks to constrain or guide risky tool behavior.

**Feature slice**
- pre-tool execution checks,
- allow/deny/confirm behavior for risky actions,
- prompt/tool guidance injection,
- visible “why blocked” explanation in the TUI,
- configurable local safety policy.

**Why this matters**
This is one of the most interesting parts of Strands. A coding agent without steering becomes a demo; a coding agent with steering becomes a platform.

**Success test for Phase 4**
- dangerous commands or writes can be intercepted,
- the TUI shows the intervention reason,
- safe actions still flow normally,
- tests cover steering decisions for allowed, denied, and guided cases.

### Phase 5, Sessions, resumability, and multi-agent-ready seams

**Objective**
Make the app feel like a real agent workstation by adding session persistence and clean seams for later multi-agent or MCP expansion.

**Feature slice**
- session save/load,
- transcript persistence,
- basic workspace profile config,
- model/provider switching,
- architecture seams for MCP tools or sub-agents later.

**Why this matters**
This phase turns a cool demo into a platform Steve can iterate on interactively over time.

**Success test for Phase 5**
- user can reopen a past session,
- transcripts and metadata persist correctly,
- config switching works without breaking the runtime,
- tests cover session serialization and config loading.

## Testing strategy by phase

### Test layers

1. **Unit tests**
   - model/runtime wrappers,
   - tool registration,
   - steering decisions,
   - session serialization.

2. **Integration tests**
   - agent runtime + tool invocation,
   - TUI action flow where practical,
   - transcript/artifact generation.

3. **Manual acceptance checks**
   - launch app,
   - run a coding task,
   - inspect event log,
   - confirm steering behavior,
   - restore a saved session.

### Definition of “phase complete”

A phase is only done when:
- the feature works locally,
- tests exist for the critical path,
- README usage notes are updated,
- and the TUI demonstrates the new capability clearly.

## How to run locally

### Setup

```bash
cd /home/steve/.openclaw/workspace/strands_agent
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

### Launch the TUI

```bash
strands-agent
```

Current default behavior uses the fake runtime, which is intentional for Phase 1 verification.

### Override runtime or model at launch

You can now override config per launch without editing environment defaults:

```bash
strands-agent --runtime fake
strands-agent --runtime live --model gpt-4.1-mini
```

This matters because it makes runtime experimentation explicit and visible, which is useful for comparing fake vs live Strands behavior during development.

### Use live runtime locally

If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is already present in your shell environment, you can switch the app to live mode without storing any secrets in the repo:

```bash
export STRANDS_AGENT_RUNTIME=live
export STRANDS_AGENT_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
strands-agent
```

The app will then use the Strands SDK with the OpenAI model provider.

### Live smoke check

To verify the live runtime outside the TUI:

```bash
export STRANDS_AGENT_RUNTIME=live
export STRANDS_AGENT_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
python scripts/live_smoke.py
```

Expected result is a short successful reply plus a provider/mode line.

### Run tests

```bash
pytest
```

### What the current tests prove

- `tests/test_runtime.py`
  - fake runtime returns deterministic output
  - empty prompt handling works
  - runtime builder defaults safely
  - live runtime selection works
  - live runtime fails safely when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing
  - config merge logic applies CLI-style overrides safely

- `tests/test_app.py`
  - app renders runtime status
  - entering text and pressing Enter updates the transcript/history
  - status line reflects turn count, runtime mode, and selected model
  - runtime failures are rendered in the UI instead of crashing silently
  - CLI argument parsing overrides runtime/model selection correctly

This is the current anti-regression contract for Phase 1.

## Suggested near-term technical choices

My current recommendation:
- **Python** for fastest alignment with the Strands Python SDK,
- **Textual** for the TUI,
- **pytest** for tests,
- a thin runtime abstraction around Strands so the UI is not tightly coupled to SDK details.

Why this stack:
- Strands Python looks mature enough for fast iteration,
- Textual is probably the fastest path to a pleasant TUI with panes and event views,
- keeping the runtime wrapper thin should make the learning sharper.

## Next highest-value implementation order

1. add the first workspace-aware coding tools, starting with read-only file inspection and directory listing
2. surface tool activity in a small event/timeline pane instead of burying everything in chat history
3. thread workspace identity into the UI so the agent's operating context is always visible
4. keep the fake runtime path green while introducing real tool registration seams
5. grow observability and steering on top of the tested runtime seam

1. scaffold Python project + TUI entrypoint
2. add thin Strands runtime wrapper
3. get one prompt/response loop working
4. add coding tools and event timeline
5. add steering hooks before broadening tool power

## What Steve should learn from this repo

By building this in phases, Steve should come away with a practical understanding of:
- how Strands structures an agent loop,
- how tools are exposed and controlled,
- how observability should work for a coding agent,
- how steering hooks can outperform prompt-only guardrails,
- and where Strands is strong or awkward as a foundation for an interactive agent platform.

## Daily prototype run policy

Future daily iterations should:
- continue in this repo rather than creating unrelated prototypes,
- implement one meaningful phase step at a time,
- keep the app runnable,
- keep tests green or clearly document failures,
- and update this README as the architecture and findings evolve.

## Next iteration ideas

- add a read-only workspace tool pair (`list_files`, `read_file`) to start Phase 2 conservatively
- introduce a dedicated event pane so tool activity can be inspected separately from assistant prose
- add a small workspace banner or footer section showing current repo/root context
- keep live runtime support optional so fake-mode regression tests stay fast and deterministic
