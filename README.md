# strands_agent

Prototype repo for learning the **Strands Agent SDK** deeply by building a simple, interactive **terminal UI coding-agent platform**.

The goal is not to clone Claude Code or Kiro exactly. The goal is to understand the Strands mental model by building a compact platform that feels similar in spirit:
- chat-first,
- tool-using,
- coding-oriented,
- interactive in a terminal,
- incrementally extensible.

This repo should stay focused on one core question:

**What is the smallest useful coding-agent platform we can build using Strands as the primary agent runtime?**

## Product direction

Build a local TUI app that launches a coding agent workspace with:
- a conversation pane,
- tool execution visibility,
- file/workspace awareness,
- session history,
- and guardrails/steering hooks.

The platform should help Steve learn Strands by making the agent loop visible and hackable rather than hidden behind a black box.

## Why this prototype

Strands appears to be a strong fit for this because it gives us:
- a model-driven agent loop,
- tool definitions as normal functions,
- MCP support,
- streaming support,
- steering hooks / middleware,
- multi-agent extensibility later.

That makes it a very good substrate for a coding-agent TUI where the interesting part is not just chat, but:
- how tools are exposed,
- how the loop is observed,
- how tool calls are steered,
- how state/history is managed,
- and how coding workflows feel in practice.

## Initial product shape

The first version should be a Python TUI application that:
- opens in the terminal,
- lets the user type tasks/questions,
- runs a Strands agent behind the scenes,
- shows streaming responses,
- shows tool calls/results as separate UI events,
- can operate against a local workspace,
- and supports a small built-in coding-tool set.

## First five phases

The first five phases should optimize for learning Strands through a runnable vertical slice, not for shipping a giant framework.

### Phase 1, Basic Strands-backed TUI shell

**Objective**
Build a minimal terminal UI that can:
- start,
- render a prompt/input area,
- send a user message to a Strands agent,
- and display the streamed or final assistant response.

**Feature slice**
- basic TUI layout,
- single-session chat loop,
- one configurable model provider,
- simple Strands runtime wrapper,
- local dev quickstart.

**Why this is first**
This proves the base interaction loop and forces us to understand the core Strands API surface before we add coding complexity.

**Success test for Phase 1**
- app launches locally with one command,
- user can enter a prompt,
- Strands agent produces a response in the TUI,
- a smoke test validates app startup + runtime invocation boundary.

### Phase 2, Coding tools + workspace awareness

**Objective**
Add a compact local toolbelt so the agent can act like a coding assistant in a workspace.

**Feature slice**
- read file tool,
- write/edit file tool,
- list/search workspace tool,
- shell command tool with conservative limits,
- current working directory / repo context indicator in UI.

**Why this matters**
This is the point where the app stops being a generic chat shell and starts becoming a coding-agent platform.

**Success test for Phase 2**
- agent can inspect files and propose/edit code in a test workspace,
- TUI visibly shows tool calls and results,
- integration tests validate tool registration and at least one workspace task end-to-end.

### Phase 3, Agent event timeline + observability

**Objective**
Make the Strands loop legible by exposing intermediate events, tool uses, failures, and timings in the TUI.

**Feature slice**
- event log pane,
- structured rendering for tool call start/end,
- token/latency counters where feasible,
- error surfacing,
- saved run transcript/artifact output.

**Why this matters**
If the goal is to understand Strands deeply, hidden orchestration is the enemy. This phase turns the loop into something inspectable.

**Success test for Phase 3**
- a user can distinguish model output from tool activity,
- failed tools/errors are visible in the UI,
- transcript artifacts are written to disk,
- tests validate event serialization/rendering.

### Phase 4, Steering hooks + safety rails

**Objective**
Use Strands steering/middleware style hooks to constrain or guide risky tool behavior.

**Feature slice**
- pre-tool execution checks,
- allow/deny/confirm behavior for risky actions,
- prompt/tool guidance injection,
- visible “why blocked” explanation in the TUI,
- configurable local safety policy.

**Why this matters**
This is one of the most interesting parts of Strands. A coding agent without steering becomes a demo; a coding agent with steering becomes a platform.

**Success test for Phase 4**
- dangerous commands or writes can be intercepted,
- the TUI shows the intervention reason,
- safe actions still flow normally,
- tests cover steering decisions for allowed, denied, and guided cases.

### Phase 5, Sessions, resumability, and multi-agent-ready seams

**Objective**
Make the app feel like a real agent workstation by adding session persistence and clean seams for later multi-agent or MCP expansion.

**Feature slice**
- session save/load,
- transcript persistence,
- basic workspace profile config,
- model/provider switching,
- architecture seams for MCP tools or sub-agents later.

**Why this matters**
This phase turns a cool demo into a platform Steve can iterate on interactively over time.

**Success test for Phase 5**
- user can reopen a past session,
- transcripts and metadata persist correctly,
- config switching works without breaking the runtime,
- tests cover session serialization and config loading.

## Testing strategy by phase

### Test layers

1. **Unit tests**
   - model/runtime wrappers,
   - tool registration,
   - steering decisions,
   - session serialization.

2. **Integration tests**
   - agent runtime + tool invocation,
   - TUI action flow where practical,
   - transcript/artifact generation.

3. **Manual acceptance checks**
   - launch app,
   - run a coding task,
   - inspect event log,
   - confirm steering behavior,
   - restore a saved session.

### Definition of “phase complete”

A phase is only done when:
- the feature works locally,
- tests exist for the critical path,
- README usage notes are updated,
- and the TUI demonstrates the new capability clearly.

## Suggested near-term technical choices

My current recommendation:
- **Python** for fastest alignment with the Strands Python SDK,
- **Textual** for the TUI,
- **pytest** for tests,
- a thin runtime abstraction around Strands so the UI is not tightly coupled to SDK details.

Why this stack:
- Strands Python looks mature enough for fast iteration,
- Textual is probably the fastest path to a pleasant TUI with panes and event views,
- keeping the runtime wrapper thin should make the learning sharper.

## Next highest-value implementation order

1. scaffold Python project + TUI entrypoint
2. add thin Strands runtime wrapper
3. get one prompt/response loop working
4. add coding tools and event timeline
5. add steering hooks before broadening tool power

## What Steve should learn from this repo

By building this in phases, Steve should come away with a practical understanding of:
- how Strands structures an agent loop,
- how tools are exposed and controlled,
- how observability should work for a coding agent,
- how steering hooks can outperform prompt-only guardrails,
- and where Strands is strong or awkward as a foundation for an interactive agent platform.

## Daily prototype run policy

Future daily iterations should:
- continue in this repo rather than creating unrelated prototypes,
- implement one meaningful phase step at a time,
- keep the app runnable,
- keep tests green or clearly document failures,
- and update this README as the architecture and findings evolve.
